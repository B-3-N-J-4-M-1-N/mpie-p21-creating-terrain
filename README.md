# Practical 2.1: Creating a Mountainous Terrain

In the last lecture, you learned about how terrain is created and represented in an Interactive Environment. You also learned about a number of different approaches for creating terrain using Unity and Photoshop. In this practical, you are going to use these approaches to create the terrain for a simple mountainous environment.

By the end of this practical you will:

- Be able to create a Unity terrain object using either: an imported heightmap, a heightmap created using the terrain editor a procedurally generated heightmap
- Be able to add multiple textures to a terrain using interactive texture splatting in Unity
- Be able to add a character controller prefab to a terrain, so that it can be explored in the first person perspective
